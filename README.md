## Arquitetura da solução

This project is console interactive.

It’ll start off by asking the user to specify the location of the File they want to open. If the file is the wrong type or is not existent, a warning will be displayed to the user and the Program will have to be reopened. It will then go to the main Menu as it loads and divides the content on the selected File.

On the Menu, the user will be asked if they want information on the Stars or the Planets, as well as if they want to close the Program.
